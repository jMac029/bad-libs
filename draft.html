<p class = "sans-serif">A <span id="cursive">noun</span> in Kentucky was arrested this morning after he <span id="cursive">verb</span> in front of a house. </p>
 


 <p class = "sans-serif"> <span id="cursive">Proper noun</span> had a history of <span id="cursive">verb</span>, but no one - not even his <span id= "cursive">"noun"</span> - ever imagined he’d verb) with a <span id="cursive">noun</span> stuck in his <span id="cursive">body part</span>. 
 I always thought he was <span id="cursive">adjective</span>, but i never thought he’d do something like this. Even his <span id="cursive">relative</span> was surprised.'
 After a brief <span id="cursive">activity</span>, cops followed him to a <span id="cursive">fast food restaurant</span>, where he reportedly <span id="cursive">adjective, past tense</span> in the fry machine. 
 In (month), a woman was charged with a similar crime. 
 But rather than <span id="cursive">verb</span>, a with a <span id="cursive">noun</span>, she (verb, past tense) with a <span id="cursive">adjective</span> dog. 
 Either way, we imagine that after witnessing him <span id="cursive">verb</span> with a <span id="cursive">noun</span> there are probably a whole lot of <span id ="cursive">plural noun</span> that are going to need some therapy.</p>
